Scripts under development for submission of amplicon sequence data to the ENA within the R environment.

# Why do sequence submission in R?
Submitting sequences to the ENA is quite an involved process, and it can take time. There are a variety of ways to submit, but I'm unaware of any routines for doing it in R. Since most researchers working on amplicon sequence data are familiar with working in the R environment, it makes sense to have scripts available to submit directly from R.
Personally, I never really know if I'm submitting correctly, so at least making the code available allows me to reproduce (and hopefully correct) any mistakes.
